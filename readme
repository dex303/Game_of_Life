Stage 5/5: Gamify it
Description
As we did in the previous stage, we are going to make application interactive. Just add two buttons: one should toggle pause/resume, another should start evolution over again, with a different initial state.
 
After this, you will have an application that provides a comfortable experience of the Game of Life. Optionally you can add more features:
increasing/decreasing evolution speed (use buttons or JSlider)
color of cells (use JColorChooser or JComboBox)
setting size of the new field (use JTextField or JDialog)
save/load (use JFileChooser)
and so on.
For the testing reasons, you need to set the name of each component using the method component.setName(String name).
Name your labels with names "GenerationLabel" and "AliveLabel". Name your buttons with names "PlayToggleButton" and "ResetButton".
